## Original Idea
Two years ago, in a second hand book shop, I found a quite old copy of the book "Seeing Beneath the Soil" (Anthony Clark, 1990), where a number of differen geophysical survey methods were described, including some basic electronic schematics of the machines used for them. 

From all of them, I found the resitivity survey the easiest method that could be madeusing cheap tools and materials.
