## Original Idea

Two years ago, in a second hand book shop, I found a quite old copy of the book "Seeing Beneath the Soil" (Anthony Clark, 1990), where a number of differen geophysical survey methods were described, including some basic electronic schematics of the machines used for them. 
From all of them, I found the resitivity survey the easiest method that could be made using common tools and materials.

## First attempt

I found the report "Bevan, Bruce. (2002). A Simple Resistivity Meter."	[Academia.edu link](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272489114_A_Simple_Resistivity_Meter), where the building of a simple Wenner array resistivity device meter is discussed.
